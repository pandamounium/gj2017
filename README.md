# TBD (gj2017)

2D Platformer : Created during the "Game Off" Game Jam (NOV-DEC 2017).

## Getting Started

This 2D platformer project is being created as a fun learning experience and jam contribution for: 
* [Game Off - Jam on Itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017)

## Built With
The project is built using Unity 2017 (Personal Edition), and several free utilities to help streamline the creation process.

Tiled - this tool is used to import tile and turn them into usable tilemaps. Once in tilemaps, the tiles can be placed in their utility to quickly design and build level designs which can then be imported in Unity using another tool. (Collision can also be added to individual tiles in Tiled ahead of time!)

Tiled2Unity - this tool is used to import the outputted .tmx and .tsx files from Tiled into the Unity Editor. It neatly packs the files into their own folders as prefabs.

* [Unity 5.5.x+](https://unity3d.com/unity/) - Game Editor and Project Core.
* [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) - Make TileMaps, and Design Game Levels.
* [Tiled2Unity](http://www.seanba.com/tiled2unity) - Import Tiled Game Levels.

C# - most knowledge is being learned through various tutorials on youtube, and free resources on the internet as the project is progressing.
